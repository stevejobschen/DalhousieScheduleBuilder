Dal Schedule Builder is a web app built for Dalhousie students registering for classes. As a student myself, registering for classes was a pain, I'd hand draw a table and fill in classes. When I came upon a conflict, I would need to erase the classes from my table. This, as well as  having to record all current CRN's, left me with a messy page. Hopefully this helps some people.

## How do I keep classes up-to-date?
Web scrapping [Dal TimeTable](https://dalonline.dal.ca/PROD/fysktime.P_DisplaySchedule) for the information.
